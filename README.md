# Hypermedia-Project-Part-1

## [CV WEBPAGE](curriculum.html)

## Target user profile:
The target user profile of this project would be some Human Resources Officer from a company looking for a programmer, software engineer, full-stack programmer, etc. 
Ideally someone who also knows about web programming, to check my programming level and see if I could fit in the company. I made the resume content simple but eye-catching.


## Information architecture:
All the information on the web page is mainly divided into 2 div’s, the main and the sections-nav-container.

The main is the one that contains all the main content of the web page. It’s divided into 5 sections:
-	Section-1: 
The home section of the page. It only contains the avatar image, my full name, and a little description about myself.

-	Section-2:
In this second section, the studies completed so far and the ones I am currently taking appear. There’s a link in the name of the degree I am studying which redirects to the UdG website where all the information about this degree is explained.

-	Section-3:
Section showing the programming languages I've worked with. These are displayed using a scrollbar.

-	Section-4:
This section shows the languages I speak accompanied by a global rating or qualification according to my level of writing, reading and speaking for each.

-	Section-5:
The last section of the web page consists of 3 parts, the first contains my email and phone number, the second my address, and the third has a link to my linktree, a website that allows you to gather all links from my different social media in one place (since I won't be using it at the moment, it's empty).


The other part that makes up the web is the section browser (sections-nav-container). This shows the different titles of the sections with an internal link to them.

Finally there’s a static footer where it just appears the name of the person who made the webpage.


## Visual design:
For the design of the entire webpage I used a blue color palette, and here’s a short explanation on the content design of each section:
-	Section-1: I made the avatar image rounded and I putted a big font size to captivate the user attention.
-	Section-2: In this second section, I have put the div’s side by side to make them look better
-	Section-3: Here I created a small scrollbar to scroll down to the different programming languages changing his esthetic according to the rest of the webpage. 
-	Section-4: In this section I made different div’s classes and organizing them making it good-looking for the user (see it in the image below). I also added an icon library to make some star ratings for the level of my languages.

-	Section-5: in the last section I did a 3 separate div’s side to side and separated by a vertical line to mark the border of them.
I also made a horizontal line between sections to mark the different sections limits clear.
For the lateral navigation bar I only made it stick statically to the right and modified the buttons style and hover.
